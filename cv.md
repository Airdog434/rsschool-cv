## About Myself
I am 22 and a final year student at university. In my opinion, the linguistic education that I am getting now is more suitable as a kind of supplement to something more useful. That's why I've decided to start studying programming and I hope to succeed in it:)
* **My strengths are:**
    + Good knowledge of the English language
    + decision-making skills
    + Good organizational skills
    + teamwork skills
## Skills
* HTML
* CSS (SASS/SCSS, BEM)
* Git/GitHub
* VSCode
## Code Examples
function bmi(weight, height) {

  const bmi = weight/(height*height);
  
  return bmi <= 18.5 ? 'Underweight': bmi <= 25 ? 'Normal': bmi <= 30 ? 'Overweight': 'Obese';
}
